## **Planning and Design**

The Recipeze project began with a thorough planning process to ensure a well-structured application. Here's a breakdown of some of the steps involved:

- **User Story Creation:** User stories were crafted to capture the functionalities desired by both logged-in users (those who have created an account) and logged-out users (visitors browsing the app). This approach ensures the application caters to the needs of various user groups.
- **Wireframing with Balsamiq:** To visualize the application's layout and user interface (UI) elements, wireframes were created using Balsamiq. These wireframes are low-fidelity mockups that focus on the overall structure and user flow rather than aesthetics. 
- **Database Schema Design:**  Lucidchart was used to design the Recipeze application's database schema. A database schema essentially defines how data will be organized within the application. Lucidchart provides a visual interface to model tables, columns, data types, and relationships between them. 
- **Project Management with GitHub Projects:** To keep track of tasks, manage deadlines, and work efficiently, GitHub Projects were utilized. GitHub Projects is a built-in project management tool within the GitHub platform that allows for creating issue lists, assigning tasks, and tracking progress.

## **Deployment**

Here's a deployment section for your README tailored for a Django project using ElephantSQL and Cloudinary:

## Deployment

This Django project is designed for deployment on a platform that supports Python web applications. Here's a guideline for deployment:

**1. Project Setup:**

- Install required dependencies for deployment:
    - `env.py`
    - `Procfile`
    - `gunicorn`
    - `whitenoise`
- Update `settings.py` with:
    - ElephantSQL database configuration using `dj_database_url`.
    - Cloudinary configuration for media storage (refer to Cloudinary's Django documentation).
    - Set `DEBUG` to `False` for production.
- Initialize a Git repository and configure version control.
- Create a `Procfile` specifying the web server command (e.g., `web: gunicorn myproject.wsgi`).

**2. Platform-Specific Deployment:**
  - **Heroku:**
      - Set the Python buildpack for your app in Heroku's settings.
      - Install the `dj-database-url` and `cloudinary-storage` packages in Django.
      - Install projects requirements 
        - pip install -r requirements.txt
      -  or if they are already installed on your environment 
        - pip freeze --local > requirements.txt 
      - Set environment variables in Heroku Config Vars

      | Key | Value |
      |----|----|
      | CLOUDINARY_URL | use user's own value |
      | DATABASE_URL | use user's own value |
      | DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC | 1 (this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment) |
      | SECRET_KEY | use user's own value |

**3. Additional Notes:**

- Consider using a separate worker process for background tasks (e.g., Celery) if your project requires them. 
- You might need to configure settings related to static files serving depending on the platform.
- Refer to the platform's documentation for details on environment variables, configuration management, and scaling.
